# Image Processing Projects

This repository contains four image processing projects, each with its unique objectives and techniques. Below is a brief description of each project.

## Exercise 1: Image Processing Basics

### Main Objectives:

- Loading grayscale and RGB image representations.
- Displaying figures and images.
- Transforming RGB color images back and forth from the YIQ color space.
- Performing intensity transformations, including histogram equalization.
- Performing optimal quantization.

## Exercise 2: Signal Processing and Derivatives

### Main Objectives:

- Implementing Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) on 1D and 2D signals.
- Performing sound fast forward.
- Performing image derivative operations.

## Exercise 3: Image Pyramids and Blending

### Main Objectives:

- Construct Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids.
- Implement pyramid blending.
- Compare blending results when using different filters in the expand and reduce operations.

## Exercise 4: Panorama Image Creation

### Main Objectives:

- Create a panorama image from video.
- Registration: Detect Harris feature points, extract descriptors, and fit rigid transformations using RANSAC.
- Stitching: Combine strips from aligned images into panoramas.
